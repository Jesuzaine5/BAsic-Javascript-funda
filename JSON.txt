JSON(Javascript Object Notataion)
   -- is a file format that is commonlyt used in transporting data via API or other means
   --can be used in different programs
--key should be case sensitive and unique, dont duplicate key
//sample   let person = { 
           firstName"Lisa"  key:value
           };

JSON STRUCTURE-- a json can also have arrays as its value

              --json can also have JSONs as its value-- meron pa ulit laman na json sa loob ng json
	      --yoou can read specific values of a JSON by using its key surrounded by [] //sample: console.log(person["firstName"]);
	       --you can also read specific values of aJSON by using a period followed by the key //ONLY wrks on a "String" Key  //sample-- console.log(person.firstName);


JSON Stringify-- you can convert JSON into string by using the json
sample of STRINGIFY  let person = {
			firstName: "Lisa",
                        lastName: "Manobal",
                         age: 22 };

                         let strPerson = JSON.stringify(person);
                         console.log(strPerson);


JSON Parsing -- you can  convert valid string into JSON by using the json.parse() method,  if a string is invalid it will throw an error at the console
                  
                        let strPerson = `{"firstName": "Lisa", "lastName": "Manobal", "age": 22 }`;//  this is stringify

                        let person = JSON.parse(strPerson);
                         console.log(person);
